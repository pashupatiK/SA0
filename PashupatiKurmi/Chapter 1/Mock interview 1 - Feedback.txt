   --Your answer , sql server 2014 and sql server 2019, a bit on sql server 2022
   --choice of words...instead of personal use, you should say, I have "working knowledge" . 
   --Any topic you have heard of and atleast can talk something about it, you should always say, I have "working knowledge"
		--Professionals have always something to say about the tools/versions related with their professional work. 
		--for instance, about sql server 2016 and sql server 2017. You can always talk about the improved features that you liked to bridge 
				the gap between 2014 and 2019. 
   -- start documenting improved features (related with developers such as tsql improvements, performance improvements, new feature for developers etc)
		from its predecessors. By the time your course is over, you should have the list ready  		
   
   
   (Question) Any new features you like the most in sql server 2019, sql server 2022?
   --see the comment above
   
   (Question) Can you walk me through how you install sql server? Do you know you can save your selection in a configuration file 
   and use the file for all your future installations?
   --explaining the process in concise is an art. You would have to identify which part to just mention and which part to go a bit in detail.
   --for me, I would go in detail on feature selection, mixed mode authentication and service accounts, the other part I would just mention them.
   --I should finish it in a minute. 
   
	   --Feature selection part: (My answer)If there would be a lot of data, then I would have database engine only and replication (if required) in one server, 
			and have a separate installation for integration services and/or reporting serviecs in different servers.
			else, I will have them all in one single server. (Notice, this is the depth I want to go into. Not too much)
	   
	   --For Authentication: (My answer) Also, there would normally be applications accessing sql server from different servers sitting in different domains. So, I would normally enable mixed mode authentication. 
	   --for all internal users and appliations running under windows domain accounts, windows authentication would be set by default. 
	   
	   --For server accounts: (My answer) If integration services servers and reporting servers are installed separately, then I would think of using domain 
	   accounts as service accounts else I would leave them as NT accounts (Notice I haven't gone deep here. Go deep if interviewer grills further)  
	   
	****The need to explain everything tells the interviewer that the candidate is a rookie. 
	  
   
   (Question) What do you think Database engine does?
   --try to identify the most important thing related with any question asked. 
   --(My answer) It is a core component for insert, update, delete, retrieve data  
   --Your answer should be concise, simple and should mention the most important thing related with the topic so that even a child should understand
   
   
   
   (Question) what port number Sql Server use by default?
   --when learning big things, these small details are ignored, but these sort of questions are important. 
   --This is figure out if the candidate has worked, they would know this simple basic but important question. 
   --when you connect to instance with some other port, you would write the servername followed by a comma and the port number:
			like (AZCIDC1OLTP,555)
 
   
   (Question) What are service accounts?  What accounts do sql server use by default? Do you recommend keeping the default service account or 
   do you recommend changing it and Why?
   --simple and concise answer required so that even a child can understand. 
   
   
   (Question) What are logins vs users? 
   --If you know them in layman's term, it is ok to explain it that way. The answer does not need to be technical always.
   --(My answer): Login is like a gate code in a gated community and user is like the key to the house inside the gated community.
                --The key to the house doesn't work for other house. Same way, user has access to the databases when they have given access to only.
				
   
   (Question) What are extended events?
   --It was a deliberate difficult question to test you how you handle them.
   --I dont know is a good anwwer. You need to be identify the situation 
   --and see if you should try a logical thoughtful guess or just say I dont know
  
   (Question) What is it at  work that was very challenging for you?
   What is success for you?
   Has there been any bad thing happened in your work environemnt and how you resolved it?
   what is the worst thing happened to you at your workplace/life?
   
   --These are the thing you need to prepare ahead of time and should have really really good example. 
   --This is the time when you were challenged and how you came out of it as a winner.
   --This is the time when you can brag about the cool/difficult tool and technologies you had trouble learning but you did anyway 
		and helped the team to deliver the task on time. 
   --It is the opportnunity to show your:
	--fast learning ability (new tool but learned quickly) and throw some cool features you learned 
	--hard working nature (new tool, quickly learned and finished worked on time is an example of hard work)
	--failed initially but came out at winner
	--good individually as well as in a team.
		--for team, you can make up as if the work wasn't yours originally but you stepped up because 
		--if the work doesn't finish, your entire looks bad and you are part of that team. 
		--So, you stepped up to help your team. (shows you are a team man)
